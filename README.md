# Payment MySQL Project

## Overview

This repository contains configuration files and scripts for deploying and managing the Payment MySQL project using Jenkins and Kubernetes. Below are the details of the files included:

- `Jenkinsfile`: This file defines the Jenkins Pipeline as code, specifying the steps and stages for building, testing, and deploying the Payment MySQL project.
  
- `deploy.yaml`: This YAML file contains Kubernetes deployment configurations for deploying the Payment MySQL application to a Kubernetes cluster. It includes specifications for pods, services, and other resources required for the application's operation.

## Files

### Jenkinsfile

The `Jenkinsfile` automates the CI/CD process for the Payment MySQL project. It typically includes stages such as:

- **Build**: Compiles the project and packages it into a deployable artifact.
- **Test**: Executes unit tests, integration tests, or other tests defined for the project.
- **Deploy**: Deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster or other deployment environments.
- **Post-deployment**: Executes post-deployment tasks such as notifications or cleanup.

### deploy.yaml

The `deploy.yaml` file defines Kubernetes resources needed to deploy the Payment MySQL application. Key components may include:

- **Deployment**: Specifies the application container image, replicas, and other deployment settings.
- **Service**: Exposes the application within the Kubernetes cluster, enabling access from other services or external clients.
- **ConfigMap/Secret**: Stores configuration data or sensitive information required by the application.
- **Ingress**: Configures access rules and routing for external access to the application.

## Usage

To use these files:

1. **Jenkinsfile**: Configure Jenkins to use this file as the Pipeline script. Adjust stages and steps as per your project requirements and environment.
   
2. **deploy.yaml**: Apply this configuration to your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml`. Ensure Kubernetes is properly configured and the necessary secrets/configmaps are available.
